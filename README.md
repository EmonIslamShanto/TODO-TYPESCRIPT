ToDo App - Powered by TypeScript and Vite
This project is a simple yet powerful ToDo app built with TypeScript and Vite, designed for task management. The app allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The goal of this project is to showcase a modern web development workflow using Vite for blazing-fast development and TypeScript for better tooling and reliability.

üöÄ Features
Add New Tasks: Input tasks with ease and see them displayed in a clean UI.
Mark as Complete/Incomplete: Toggle between completed and pending tasks.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks once completed or no longer needed.
Fast Development Environment: Vite ensures near-instant reloads and builds.
üõ† Installation & Setup
To get this project running locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Node.js installed, then install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Run the Development Server
Start the app in development mode, which will automatically open it in your default browser.

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Navigate to http://localhost:5173 to see the app running.

4. Build for Production
To create a production-ready build of the app, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
5. Preview the Build Locally
After building, you can preview your production build to ensure everything works as expected:

bash
Copy code
npm run preview
üß∞ Technologies Used
TypeScript: Typed superset of JavaScript to help catch errors early and provide better tooling.
Vite: Next-gen frontend tooling for lightning-fast builds and development.
HTML5 & CSS3: For structuring and styling the app.

üîß Available Scripts
Here are some helpful npm scripts for development and deployment:

Command	Description
npm run dev	Start the development server with hot-reload support
npm run build	Build the app for production (minified, optimized)
npm run preview	Preview the production build locally
npm run lint	Lint your code for potential errors (if linting is set up)
npm run format	Format the code using Prettier (if Prettier is configured)
üíª How It Works
Adding a Task: Users can input a task in the text field and submit it using the "Add" button or by pressing Enter.
Marking as Complete: Each task has a checkbox. Checking it marks the task as complete, changing its visual appearance.
Deleting a Task: Users can delete a task by clicking on the "Delete" button next to it.
